**JsonicYouth** is a non-lossy JSON parser written in Swift.  It parses JSON data while preserving the exact data contents and formatting, including whitespace.  

The intended use is for JSON processing tools, viewers, editors and such.  For your app's JSON parsing needs, `JSONSerialization` or wrappers such as [Unbox](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Unbox) is recommended. 

See unit tests for usage examples.
